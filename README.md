## Task 2 :- Timeline Extension

Dear Sir/Ma'am,
        I am writing this mail to request a deadline extension for the task. I was supposed to submit
the final delivery for the task on Feb. 06, 2023, but, regretfully, that won’t be possible. The reason
behind this is I fell into some genuine family issues due to which I won’t be able to work on the
project at least till the issues not get resolved.
        As I have already completed a large portion of the task, will it be possible to get an
extension on the deadline to finish the remaining ones. I expect to be able to use my hand again
by Feb. 09. So I request you to please allow me an extension for three days post the exact delivery 
date.

I regret the delay this will cause in your publication schedule. I will complete the work as soon as possible.

Thank you in advance for considering my situation.

Sincerely,
Bhavesh Chavhan
